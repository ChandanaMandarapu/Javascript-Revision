1. Synchronous vs Asynchronous:
Synchronous: Imagine you are in a queue to buy tickets for a movie. You have to wait for the person in front of you to finish before it's your turn. That's like synchronous, one thing at a time, in order.
Asynchronous: Now, think about ordering food online. You don't wait in a line. You place your order and go do other things. The restaurant will let you know when your food is ready. This is like asynchronous – you don't have to wait around doing nothing.
2. Callback Functions:
Callback Function: It's like asking a friend to call you back when they have some information. You give them your number (callback function), and they use it when they're ready.
3. Event Loop:
Event Loop: Think of it as a traffic cop managing busy intersections. The cop makes sure cars (tasks) move smoothly, and everyone gets their turn. In our code, the event loop keeps things running smoothly and makes sure everything happens in the right order.
4. Promises:
Promises: Imagine ordering a book online. The website promises to deliver it to you. The promise has three states – waiting for the book (pending), getting the book (fulfilled), or the bookstore running out of the book (rejected).
5. Async/Await:
Async/Await: It's like waiting for your turn at a playground slide. You stand in line (async), and when it's finally your turn (await), you go down the slide. Async/Await makes waiting for things in code feel more like waiting for your turn in real life.
6. Promise Chaining:
Promise Chaining: Think of it like a chain reaction. You promise to do something, and when that's done, you promise to do another thing. It's like a series of promises, each leading to the next one.
7. Error Handling in Promises:
Error Handling: Imagine making a sandwich. If you run out of peanut butter, you need a plan (error handling). Maybe you'll use jelly instead. In code, we handle errors by having a backup plan so the program doesn't crash.
8. Parallel vs Sequential Execution:
Parallel vs Sequential: Picture cooking dinner. If you do one thing at a time, like chopping vegetables first and then boiling water, that's sequential. If you do multiple things at once, like chopping and boiling simultaneously, that's parallel. Code can work in both ways.
9. Ajax and Fetch:
Ajax and Fetch: It's like ordering pizza. Ajax is like calling the pizza place and waiting for them to deliver. Fetch is like ordering online and doing other things until the pizza arrives.
10. Generators:
Generators: Think of it as a pause button in a video game. The game stops for a moment, and you decide what to do next. Generators let you pause and continue your code when you're ready.
11. Observable Pattern:
Observable Pattern: Imagine you have a pet fish. When you feed it, the fish reacts. Your action (feeding) is observed by the fish. In code, one part of the program observes changes in another part.
12. WebSockets:
WebSockets: It's like having a phone call instead of sending letters. With letters, you send a message and wait for a reply. With a phone call (WebSocket), you can have a back-and-forth conversation in real-time.
13. Microtasks and Macrotasks:
Microtasks and Macrotasks: Picture you have two lists – one for small tasks (microtasks) and another for big tasks (macrotasks). You finish the small tasks quickly, but the big tasks take more time. The event loop decides which list to handle first.
14. Callback Hell:
Callback Hell: Imagine making a sandwich and then realizing you need to make coffee, so you start that, and then remember you left the sandwich. It's like a never-ending loop. We avoid this in code by using promises or async/await, so it's clear what happens next.
15. Promises vs Callbacks:
Promises vs Callbacks: Callbacks are like waiting for a friend to finish talking before you can speak. Promises are like sending a message to your friend, and they'll reply when they have an answer. Promises are neater and easier to manage.
16. Async/Await Best Practices:
Best Practices: It's like having a to-do list. You write down your tasks in order, so you know what to do next. With async/await, we use try-catch to handle errors like having a backup plan for unexpected things.
17. Event Loop Interview Questions:
Event Loop Questions: Imagine someone asking you, "How does the traffic cop manage the intersection?" You'd explain how the cop ensures everyone gets their turn. In code, they might ask, "How does the event loop manage tasks?"
18. Ajax vs Fetch:
Ajax vs Fetch: It's like comparing calling the pizza place (Ajax) to ordering online (Fetch). Fetch is newer and simpler, like using an app to order pizza instead of making a call.
