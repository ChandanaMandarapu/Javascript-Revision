Promises:
1. What is a Promise?
Imagine you ask your friend to bring you a surprise gift tomorrow. The friend makes a promise â€“ they'll either give you the gift (fulfilled) or say they couldn't get it (rejected). That's a promise in real life.
2. States of a Promise:
Pending: Your friend hasn't decided on the gift yet.
Fulfilled: Your friend got the gift and gives it to you.
Rejected: Your friend couldn't find the gift and apologizes.
3. How Promises Work:
It's like ordering a package online. You place an order (make a promise), and the website tells you it's either on the way (fulfilled) or if there's a problem (rejected).
4. Chaining Promises:
Imagine asking for two gifts from two friends. You don't want to wait for one to finish before asking the other. Promises let you ask for gifts from multiple friends and get them when each friend is ready.
Async/Await:
1. What is Async/Await?
Async/Await is like waiting for your turn at a playground slide. When you're in line (async), you can do other things. When it's your turn (await), you go down the slide (complete the task).
2. Making Asynchronous Code Look Sync:
Think of it as doing homework. Without async/await, you might have to wait for each question's answer before moving on. With async/await, you can work on different questions while waiting for the answers.
3. Using Async/Await with Promises:
Imagine asking your friend for a gift, and your friend says they will get it tomorrow (a promise). Async/Await is like saying, "Okay, I'll do other things today, and tomorrow, I'll wait for the gift from my friend."
4. Error Handling with Async/Await:
Picture this: You plan a day out, but it might rain. You bring an umbrella just in case. Async/Await lets you bring an "umbrella" in your code, preparing for unexpected things.
5. Example - Fetching Data:
Let's say you want to fetch information from a website. With async/await, it's like telling your computer, "Hey, go get this info, and I'll wait until you bring it back." It keeps things organized and easy to understand.
