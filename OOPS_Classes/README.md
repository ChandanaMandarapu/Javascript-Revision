Overview of Topics Covered:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile programming language that supports OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Understanding OOP in JavaScript is essential for building structured and maintainable code.

2. Object Prototypes
Prototypes are a fundamental part of JavaScript's object system. They enable objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects, forming a chain known as the prototype chain.

3. Prototypes
Prototypes in JavaScript serve as templates for objects. Understanding how to work with prototypes is crucial for creating efficient and reusable code.

4. Classes
JavaScript introduced class syntax in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), providing a more structured and familiar way to define object constructors and inheritance. Classes simplify OOP implementation in JavaScript.

5. Inheritance
Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. It's a core concept in OOP, and JavaScript supports both prototype-based and class-based inheritance.

6. Call, Apply, and Bind
Call, apply, and bind are methods used to control the value of this in JavaScript functions. They are important for managing function context and can be used in various scenarios.

7. Getters and Setters
Getters and setters are special methods that allow you to control access to object properties. They are used to encapsulate and protect data within objects.

8. Lexical Scope and Closures
Lexical scope defines how variables are accessed and resolved based on their location in the code. Closures are a powerful concept related to scope, enabling functions to remember their lexical scope even when executed elsewhere.
